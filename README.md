# CITS3403

## Notes

This was done as project 1 for my CITS3403 Agile Web Development unit. We could not employ the use of any frameworks (CSS or JS) and had to build everything from scratch. I ended up building a comprehensive CSS Framework as well as a rudimentary router with router views and components.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser or your choice.
2. For the login section of the website, use `test@test.com` as the username and `password` as the password.
3. The register form is functional and will register a user for that session (until a page refresh or navigated away from).
4. The site is only persistant when not refreshed or navigated away from.
5. The dashboard portion of the site is non-functional.
